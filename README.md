## Why I build it

I want to effectively find resources to learn skills that I'm missing for a certain role

## Development is still on going

## Issues

-**Application Startups takes some time**: We are initliazing an NER model that reads from a techinical skills database
-**Skills identification not complete**: Some skills are still being left out when comparing resume with job descriptions
-**Loading Speed**: Need to speed up agent communication
